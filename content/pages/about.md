      When I made HuskerJS, I basically wanted to get a blog out a quickly as I
      could so I could join in on the chorus of Husker alumni who felt that
      Scott Frost had torn everything we love away from us and smashed it with a
      hammer to tiny little pieces that could never be repaired again. I felt
      that maybe it would make me feel better,  and honestly the more truthful
      reason, was that I hoped somebody saw that I could make a blog quickly and
      easily and think "Hey, that guy is pretty good - I should hire him!". That
      never happened.


      ## Not Much Happened


      So the disappointing thing about it all was that while Huskerjs.dev had
      good intentions and I put a decent bit of effort into the project to make
      a website that at least looked nice and had a little bit of content, it
      really didn't get much attention at all. The number one reason for that
      was because I just simply didn't keep up with content at all. Like so many
      projects in the past, I simply got bored and moved onto something shinier
      and newer.


      Fast-forward and it is now 2024. I need some projects for my portfolio and
      I also smell college football season right around the corner. Next weekend
      is kick off for Nebraska and most of the rest of the nation as Week 0 just
      took place this weekend. The motivator to get out and create HuskerJS this
      weekend was that I missed the only real game on Saturday between Georgia
      Tech and Florida State - and I missed a damn upset!


      ## Been out of the loop


      I also feel like I have missed out on a lot this summer. The situation I
      am dealing with right now has me dealing with the pressing issues of my
      day-to-day life which involve needing to find work, find housing, and more
      important things than reading about college football all day like I would
      love to do. But life doesn't always give us what we want so I am stuck
      with missing a lot of preseason story lines, NCAA Football 25's comeback
      video game release, and even the Husker spring game. 


      I am going to spend an immense amount of time this week catching up for
      the season, scraping sites for CFB stats, and creating models so I can
      make predictions and win some bets this college football season. I also
      just want to know what is going on so I can have fun and enjoy this season
      like everybody else. 


      ## I hope you enjoy HuskerJS


      So I haven't shared what all my plans are with this project yet - it is
      mostly going to be a lot of blogging but I have some surprise features in
      store for y'all with this years project. I know I will be doing a
      newsletter you can subscribe to, but I can tell you that the newsletter I
      am going to create is going to be a surprise and some of the features on
      this site are going to be a fun surprise. 


      Hopefully y'all enjoy my creation and the extras that I have time to
      develop each week and share with an audience I'm grateful to have. If you
      find what I create fun, interesting or helpful, feel free to contribute to
      my Patreon, Ko-Fi, or any other of the platforms I create on to support my
      work.


      Thank you for reading and I hope you have a great college football season!
